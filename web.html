  <h2>What are Vector Images?</h2>
  <p>Unlike JPEGs, GIFs, and BMP images, vector graphics are not made up of a grid of pixels. Instead, vector graphics are comprised of paths,
    which are defined by a start and end point, along with other points, curves, and angles along the way.</p>
  <h2>What makes them different from Raster Images?</h2>
  <p>Because vector-based images are not made up of a specific number of dots, they can be scaled to a larger size and not lose any image quality.
    If you blow up a raster graphic, it will look blocky, or "pixelated."
    When you blow up a vector graphic, the edges of each object within the graphic stay smooth and clean.</p>
